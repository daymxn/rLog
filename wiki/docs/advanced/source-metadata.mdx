# Source Metadata

Source Metadata is data attached to log entries that represent metadata regarding where the log occurred.

This data can be useful for better error tracing, or supporting certain features.

:::info what you'll learn

- What source metadata is
- How source metadata is attached to logs
- The different components of source metadata

:::

## Overview

At its core, source metadata is just a simple type.

```ts
export type SourceMetadata = {
  function_name?: string;
  nearest_function_name?: string;
  file_path: string;
  line_number: number;
};
```

You can find this type on log entries under the `source_metadata` property.

```ts
export type LogEntry = {
  level: LogLevel;
  message: string;
  data: LogData;
  encoded_data: LogData;
  config: Writable<RLogConfig>;
  context?: LogContext;
  timestamp: number;
  // highlight-next-line
  source_metadata: SourceMetadata;
};
```

### Function Name

The `function_name` property of source metadata contains the name of the function where the log occurred.

This may be `undefined` if the log occurred in an anonymous function.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog({
  enrichers: [
    (entry) => {
      entry.message = entry.source_metadata.function_name;
      return entry;
    },
  ],
});

function GivePlayerMoney() {
  logger.i("Where am I?");
}

GivePlayerMoney();
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: GivePlayerMoney
```

### Nearest Function Name

If the instance was created in an anonymous function, it won't have a name. Even if the outer scope was a named
function.

To solve this, you can use the `nearest_function_name` property instead.

If the function _does_ have a name though, `nearest_function_name` will point to the same thing as `function_name`.

:::warning

If you somehow have a stack full of anonymous functions, it's possible for `nearest_function_name` to be `undefined` as
well.

:::

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog({
  enrichers: [
    (entry) => {
      entry.message = entry.source_metadata.nearest_function_name;
      return entry;
    },
  ],
});

function GivePlayerMoney() {
  const doStuff = () => {
    logger.i("Where am I?");
  };

  doStuff();
}

GivePlayerMoney();
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: GivePlayerMoney
```

Notice how it says `GivePlayerMoney` instead of `doStuff`? This is because `doStuff` is _not_ a named function. It's a
variable that points to an anonymous function.\*

<i>
  <small>*technically it's an arrow function, but in luau it gets transpiled to an anonymous function</small>
</i>

### File Path

The `file_path` property of source metadata contains the full path to the file where the log occurred.

```ts title="ReplicatedStorage/TS/main.ts"
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog({
  enrichers: [
    (entry) => {
      entry.message = entry.source_metadata.file_path;
      return entry;
    },
  ],
});

function GivePlayerMoney() {
  logger.i("Where am I?");
}

GivePlayerMoney();
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: ReplicatedStorage.TS.main
```

### Line Number

The `line_number` property of source metadata contains the line in the file where the log occurred.

:::info

For example purposes, we're using the TS line number, but it's _actually_ the line number in the transpiled luau code.

:::

```ts {13} showLineNumbers
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog({
  enrichers: [
    (entry) => {
      entry.message = `${entry.source_metadata.line_number}`;
      return entry;
    },
  ],
});

function GivePlayerMoney() {
  logger.i("Where am I?");
}

GivePlayerMoney();
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: 13
```

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about source metadata:

- It contains data pertaining to **where** the log occurred.
- You can use **nearest_function_name** when dealing with anonymous functions.
- **nearest_function_name** can still be `undefined` in certain situations.
- The **line_number** is the file line number in the _transpiled luau_, not the TS source.
