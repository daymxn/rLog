# Fast Breakdown

If you're already familiar with logging libraries, or just want a quick breakdown of **rLog** without reading through
the API or guides, then this is for you.

We'll run through all the core components of **rLog** at a mid-high level, so you can get up and running quickly.

## Instance creation

**rLog** provides a default ("global") instance that you can use, but the intended usage is to create individual
instances per file or flow.

```ts
import { rLog, rLogger } from "@rbxts/rlog";

// use the default instance
rLogger.info("Hello world!");

// create your own instance
const logger = new rLog();
```

There are also alias exports that you can use in place of **rLog**, for stylistic purposes.

```ts
import { RLog, rLog, rlog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog();
const logger = new rlog();
const logger = new RLog();
```

## Basic Logging

**rLog** supports log severity levels under the `LogLevel` enum.

There are currently five types of levels.

```ts
export enum LogLevel {
	VERBOSE,
	DEBUG,
	INFO,
	WARNING,
	ERROR,
}
```

By default, `WARNING` and `ERROR` are output via `warn`, while the others are output via `print`.

All logging methods can be called directly on an `rLog` instance using the method corresponding to the level name.

Or you can call the `log` method manually.

```ts
import { rLog, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog();

logger.verbose("Hello verbose!");
logger.debug("Hello debug!");
logger.info("Hello info!");
logger.warning("Hello warning!");
logger.error("Hello error!");

logger.log(LogLevel.DEBUG, "Hello world!");
```

```logs title="Console"
[VERBOSE]: Hello verbose!
[DEBUG]: Hello debug!
[INFO]: Hello info!
[WARNING]: Hello warning!
[ERROR]: Hello error!
[DEBUG]: Hello world!
```

Each level also has at least one short-hand alias method that you can use for style purposes.

```ts
logger.verbose();
logger.v();

logger.debug();
logger.d();

logger.info();
logger.i();

logger.warning();
logger.warn();
logger.w();

logger.error();
logger.e();
```

## Configuration

**rLog** has a moderate number of configurable options available via the [RLogConfig](api/rlog.rlogconfig) and
[SerializationConfig](api/rlog.serializationconfig) types.

You can apply these in a few different ways.

### Global Settings

You can apply settings to the default instance, and they'll be applied to all **rLog** instances automatically since
they all inherit upwards.

```ts
import { rLog, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const config = {
	minLogLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG,
};

// Sets the default config, replacing any present values
rLog.SetDefaultConfig(config);

// Updates the default config, merging with the existing config
rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({ serialization: { encodeFunctions: true } });

// Resets the default config to the original values
rLog.ResetDefaultConfig();
```

:::warning

While these settings are automatically applied to all instances, they are only done so for instances created after the
method call.

If you're using context properly, this is usually not an issue though.

:::

### Instance Settings

The normal way for applying settings is through the constructor of **rLog**.

```ts
import { rLog, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog({ minLogLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG });
```

But there are also helper methods for many of the common settings that you can call on instances instead.

```ts
const logger = new rLog()
	.withConfig(myConfig)
	.withMinLogLevel(LogLevel.DEBUG)
	.withTag("Main")
	.withContext(customContext);
```

:::warning

**rLog** follows the principle of immutability.

So method calls return _new_ instances, not the current instance.

:::

## Serialization

**rLog** provides serialization out of the box; allowing you to attach "metadata" to your messages for easier debugging
and tracking.

### Basic Usage

You can pass arbitrary data as the second argument of a logging method call, and it will be internally encoded and
output alongside your message.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog();

logger.debug("User purchase made", { user: 123, order: "51015" });
```

```logs title="Console"
[DEBUG]: Hello debug!
{ data: { user: 123, order: "51015" } }
```

### ROBLOX Types & Nested Tables

The custom encoding provided by **rLog** also supports deeply nested tables and Roblox data types out of the box.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog();

logger.debug("User purchase made", {
	user: {
		id: 123,
		purchase: {
			id: 15,
			details: {
				item: "Nuke",
				result: Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted,
				position: new Vector3(10, 15, 20),
				rotation: new CFrame(),
			},
		},
	},
});
```

```logs title="Console"
[DEBUG]: Hello debug!
{
  data: {
    user: {
      id: 123,
      purchase: {
        id: 15,
        details: {
          item: "Nuke",
          result: "Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted",
          position: { X: 10, Y: 15, Z: 20 },
          rotation: "CFrame(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)",
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

While the ROBLOX console may (or may not, depending on the version) output them in a way that doesn't look like it, they
are actually output as valid JSON elements.

So the output of your messages can safely be sent to backends expecting JSON.

:::

### Classes

By default, serialization looks for a `__tostring` method on class instances to try to encode them properly. This method
is automatically generated by **rbxts** for typescript classes, with a value of the class name.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

class Person {
	constructor(public name: string) {}
}

const logger = new rLog();

const person = new Person("Daymon");

logger.debug("Person created", { me: person });
```

```logs title="Console"
[DEBUG]: Person created
{ data: { me: "Person" } }
```

While you can override this behavior by providing your own `toString` method on the class, you can also provide a custom
`encodeMethod` for the serializer to look for.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

class Person {
	constructor(public name: string) {}

	public encode() {
		return this.name;
	}
}

const logger = new rLog({ serialization: { encodeMethod: "encode" } });

const person = new Person("Daymon");

logger.debug("Person created", { me: person });
```

```logs title="Console"
[DEBUG]: Person created
{ data: { me: "Daymon" } }
```

## Enrichers

Enrichers are callbacks that can attach additional data to log entries, or mutate existing data.

```ts
export type LogEnricherCallback = (entry: LogEntry) => LogEntry;
```

### Usage

You can use enrichers by specifying them at the config level when you create your **rLog** instance.

:::tip

**rLog** comes packaged with some ready-to-use enrichers out of the box for common use-cases.

You can learn more about those in the [Provided Enrichers](./basics/enrichers#provided-enrichers) section.

:::

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

function addTimestamp(entry: LogEntry): LogEntry {
	entry.encoded_data["timestamp"] = DateTime.now();

	return entry;
}

const logger = new rLog({ enrichers: [addTimestamp] });
```

## Sinks

Sinks are callbacks that take in a log entry, and can optionally decide to prevent the log entry from propogating.

They provide a way to filter or "consume" logs.

```ts
// returning `true` means that the log should not be processed any more
export type LogSinkCallback = (entry: LogEntry, attachment: RLog, source: RLog) => boolean | void;
```

:::warning

Sinks run _after_ enrichers. So the data you see from a sink will be data that has been modified by all the enrichers
already.

:::

### Usage

You can use sinks by providing them at the config level when you create your **rLog** instance.

:::tip

**rLog** comes packaged with some ready-to-use sinks out of the box for common use-cases.

You can learn more about those in the [Provided Sinks](./basics/sinks#provided-sinks) section.

:::

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { adminList } from "./constants";

function removeAdminCalls(entry: LogEntry) {
	return entry.tag === "ADMIN" && !adminList.include(entry.encoded_data.player);
}

const logger = new rLog({ sinks: [removeAdminCalls] });
```

However, a more common use case for sinks is "consuming" logs for external storage.

```ts
import { RunService } from "@rbxts/services";
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { queueLogRequest } from "./log-database";

const debug = RunService.IsStudio();

function logToDatabase(entry: LogEntry) {
	const endpoint = debug ? "qa" : "prod";

	queueLogRequest(entry, endpoint);

	return !debug; // only allow messages through while we're in studio
}

const logger = new rLog({ sinks: [logToDatabase] });
```

:::warning

Your sinks should **not** yield, as they may otherwise cause other logs to stop being output, or cause logs to be output
out of order.

:::

## Log Context

Log Context provides a way to create linkage between log entries in an individual flow, making debugging easier in
high-traffic or asynchronous environments.

### Basic Usage

Log Context is primarily useful in cross service logging, where you want to associate all the relevant actions in a flow
with one another.

```ts title="datastore.ts"
import { rLog, LogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const config = { tag: "Datastore" };

export function AddMoney(context: LogContext, player: Player, money: number) {
	const logger = context.use(config);

	logger.i("Adding money to player save");
	// ...
	logger.i("Money added");
}
```

```ts title="player-actions.ts"
import { rLog, LogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { AddMoney } from "./datastore";

const config = { tag: "PlayerActions" };

export function GiveMoney(context: LogContext, player: Player, money: number) {
	const logger = context.use(config);

	logger.i("Giving player money", { player: player, money: money });

	AddMoney(context, player, money);

	logger.i("Money given to player");
}
```

```ts title="network.ts"
import { LogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { GiveMoney } from "./player-actions";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";

remotes.giveMoney.connect((player: Player, money: number) => {
	const context = LogContext.start();

	GiveMoney(context, player, money);

	context.stop();
});
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: PlayerActions -> Giving player money
{
  data: { player: "Player1", money: 100 },
  correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii"
}

[INFO]: Datastore -> Adding money to player save
{ correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii" }

[INFO]: Datastore -> Money added
{ correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii" }

[INFO]: PlayerActions -> Money given to player
{ correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii" }
```

:::warning

Log Context has a life cycle. Failing to call `stop` can cause memory leaks in your application.

If you'd rather not manually handle this, you can use `withLogContext` instead:

```ts
import { withLogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { GiveMoney } from "./player-actions";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";

remotes.giveMoney.connect((player: Player, money: number) => {
	// automatically starts and stops the context
	withLogContext((context) => {
		GiveMoney(context, player, money);
	});
});
```

:::

### Context Bypass

Enabling the `contextBypass` setting will allow logs with context to bypass the `minLogLevel` whenever another log in
the context is of severity `WARNING` or higher.

```ts
import { rLog, withContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({ minLogLevel: WARNING });

const config = { contextBypass: true, suspendContext: true };

withContext((context) => {
	const logger = context.use(config);

	logger.d("Some extra data");
	logger.i("Doing stuff");
	logger.w("Something happened");
	logger.i("Done");
});
```

```logs title="Console"
[DEBUG]: Some extra data
{ correlation_id: "BNPmmqDsnpLdWiPF" }

[INFO]: Doing stuff
{ correlation_id: "BNPmmqDsnpLdWiPF" }

[WARNING]: Something happened
{ correlation_id: "BNPmmqDsnpLdWiPF" }

[INFO]: Done
{ correlation_id: "BNPmmqDsnpLdWiPF" }
```

Since a `WARNING` message was sent through the context before it stopped, the rest of the messages in the context that
usually wouldn't have been sent were also sent.

This can be a huge help in avoiding extra verbose logs until you actually need them (i.e., when debugging).

### Correlation IDs

One of the biggest use cases for Log Context is Correlation IDs.

Correlation IDs provide a way to track the flow of a process, and by default Log Context create their own unique
Correlation ID when they're created- and pass it to `rLog` instances that `use` it.

```ts title="datastore.ts"
import { rLog, LogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const config = { tag: "Datastore" };

export function AddMoney(context: LogContext, player: Player, money: number) {
	const logger = context.use(config);

	logger.i("Adding money to player save");
	// ...
	logger.i("Money added");
}
```

```ts title="player-actions.ts"
import { rLog, LogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { AddMoney } from "./datastore";

const config = { tag: "PlayerActions" };

export function GiveMoney(context: LogContext, player: Player, money: number) {
	const logger = context.use(config);

	logger.i("Giving player money", { player: player, money: money });

	AddMoney(context, player, money);

	logger.i("Money given to player");
}
```

```ts title="network.ts"
import { withLogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { GiveMoney } from "./player-actions";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";

remotes.giveMoney.connect((player: Player, money: number) => {
	withLogContext((context) => {
		GiveMoney(context, player, money);
	});
});
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: PlayerActions -> Giving player money
{
  data: { player: "Player1", money: 100 },
  correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii"
}

[INFO]: Datastore -> Adding money to player save
{ correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii" }

[INFO]: Datastore -> Money added
{ correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii" }

[INFO]: PlayerActions -> Money given to player
{ correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii" }
```

Correlation IDs become especially useful in high traffic (possibly asynchronous) functions, where you may have multiple
players or systems waiting on the result of a function, but from different invocations and threads.

With Correlation IDs, you can retrieve the logs of a particular run without the noise of unrelated runs.
