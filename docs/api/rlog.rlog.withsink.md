## RLog.withSink() method

Creates a new [RLog](./rlog.rlog.md) instance with the given `sink` added.

Sinks are callbacks that take in a [LogEntry](./rlog.logentry.md) and return a boolean indicating if the entry was "consumed".

If an entry is "consumed", that means it should not be processed any more.

This is especially useful if you want to log your events to an external server, but not the local console.

In the case of multiple sinks, they are called in the order they are added.

Furthermore, child sinks are called before [parent](./rlog.rlog.child.md) sinks.

\_Note that the [LogEntry](./rlog.logentry.md) you receive will already be enriched.\_

**Signature:**

```typescript
withSink(sink: LogSinkCallback, minLevel?: LogLevel): RLog;
```

## Example


```ts
function MyCustomSink(entry: LogEntry, config: RLogConfig): boolean {
  // ... log to external server

}

const logger = new RLog().withSink(MyCustomSink);

logger.v("Hello verbose"); // no output to the console, since it was consumed.
```
