# Log Levels

Logs can have a different severity level attached to them, indicating at a quick glance the importance of a message.

:::info what you'll learn

- What log levels are
- How log levels are used
- The various helper methods to create different log messages
- How to apply a minimum log level to your logging setup

:::

## Levels

Within **rLog**, there are five possible severity levels you can use:

- Verbose
- Debug
- Info
- Warn
- Error

The levels escalate in order of importance, `Verbose` being the least important, and `Error` being the most important.

The level of a log entry is (by default) attached to the start of the message, and surrounded in brackets.

```LogLevel
[WARN]: There was an issue!
```

### Verbose

Verbose is the lowest level of logging.

Verbose messages are those that are not usually needed unless you need to see deep step-by-step processes in your
application.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { sendPayment } from "./payment";

const logger = new rLog();
// highlight-next-line
logger.verbose("Application started");

function processOrder(orderId: string, userId: string) {
  // All the logging methods have short hand aliases you can use as well
  // highlight-next-line
  logger.v("Fetching details for order", { order: orderId, user: userId });
}

processOrder("12345", "user789");
```

```logs title="Console"
[VERBOSE]: Application started
[VERBOSE]: Fetching details for order
{ data: { order: "12345", "user789" } }
```

### Debug

Debug is the second lowest level of logging.

Generally used for messages that you don't necessarily need to see at runtime, but they're useful when you need to find
out why something is happening.

Essentially, messages and data that could be useful when debugging.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { sendPayment } from "./payment";

const logger = new rLog();

logger.verbose("Application started");

function processOrder(orderId: string, userId: string) {
  logger.v("Fetching details for order", { order: orderId, user: userId });

  const orderDetails = { items: ["item1", "item2"], total: 100 };

  // highlight-next-line
  logger.d(`Retrieved order details`, { details: orderDetails });
}

processOrder("12345", "user789");
```

```logs title="Console"
[VERBOSE]: Application started
[VERBOSE]: Fetching details for order
{ data: { order: "12345", "user789" } }

// highlight-start
[DEBUG]: Retrieved order details
{ data: { details: { items: ["item1", "item2"], total: 100 } } }
// highlight-end
```

### Info

The baseline level of logging.

Useful for messages that signify an event or interaction. Usually occur only once or twice in a control flow, and are
used less for debugging, and more for seeing what's going on in your application.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { sendPayment } from "./payment";

const logger = new rLog();

logger.verbose("Application started");

function processOrder(orderId: string, userId: string) {
  // highlight-next-line
  logger.i("Processing order");

  logger.v("Fetching details for order", { order: orderId, user: userId });

  const orderDetails = { items: ["item1", "item2"], total: 100 };

  logger.d(`Retrieved order details`, { details: orderDetails });

  // highlight-next-line
  logger.i("Order complete");
}

processOrder("12345", "user789");
```

```logs title="Console"
[VERBOSE]: Application started

// highlight-next-line
[INFO]: Processing order

[VERBOSE]: Fetching details for order
{ data: { order: "12345", "user789" } }

[DEBUG]: Retrieved order details
{ data: { details: { items: ["item1", "item2"], total: 100 } } }

// highlight-next-line
[INFO]: Order complete
```

### Warning

Something that isn't necessarily breaking, but should be looked at.

Depending on your style, it may end up being used less often than the other levels.

:::info

By default, logs with a level of `WARNING` or above are sent through `warn` in the ROBLOX console, while the rest are
sent through `print`.

:::

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { sendPayment } from "./payment";

const logger = new rLog();

logger.verbose("Application started");

function processOrder(orderId: string, userId: string) {
  logger.i("Processing order");

  logger.v("Fetching details for order", { order: orderId, user: userId });

  const orderDetails = { items: ["item1", "item2"], total: 1 };

  logger.d(`Retrieved order details`, { details: orderDetails });

  if (orderDetails.total < 10) {
    // highlight-next-line
    logger.w("Order has a suspiciously low total");
  }

  logger.v("Sending order for payment");

  const paymentSuccessful = sendPayment(order, userId, orderDetails);

  if (!paymentSuccessful) {
    // highlight-next-line
    logger.w("Payment for order failed");
  }

  logger.i("Order complete");
}

processOrder("12345", "user789");
```

```logs title="Console"
[VERBOSE]: Application started

[INFO]: Processing order

[VERBOSE]: Fetching details for order
{ data: { order: "12345", "user789" } }

[DEBUG]: Retrieved order details
{ data: { details: { items: ["item1", "item2"], total: 1 } } }

// highlight-next-line
[WARNING]: Order has a suspiciously low total

[VERBOSE]: Sending order for payment

// highlight-next-line
[WARNING]: Payment for order failed

[INFO]: Order complete
```

### Error

Something went wrong, and needs to be looked at ASAP.

Usually used to indicate fatal issues or exceptions that weren't expected, and break the application.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { sendPayment } from "./payment";

const logger = new rLog();

logger.verbose("Application started");

function processOrder(orderId: string, userId: string) {
  try {
    logger.i("Processing order");

    logger.v("Fetching details for order", { order: orderId, user: userId });

    const orderDetails = { items: ["item1", "item2"], total: 1 };

    logger.d(`Retrieved order details`, { details: orderDetails });

    if (orderDetails.total < 10) {
      logger.w("Order has a suspiciously low total");
    }

    logger.v("Sending order for payment");

    const paymentSuccessful = sendPayment(order, userId, orderDetails);

    if (!paymentSuccessful) {
      logger.w("Payment for order failed");
    }

    logger.i("Order complete");
  } catch (e) {
    // highlight-start
    logger.e("An unexpected error occurred", {
      reason: e.message,
    });
    //highlight-end
  }
}

processOrder("12345", 789);
```

```logs title="Console"
[VERBOSE]: Application started

[INFO]: Processing order

[VERBOSE]: Fetching details for order
{ data: { order: "12345", 789 } }

[DEBUG]: Retrieved order details
{ data: { details: { items: ["item1", "item2"], total: 1 } } }

[WARNING]: Order has a suspiciously low total

// highlight-start
[ERROR]: An unexpected error occurred
{ data: { reason: "Invalid UserID provided! Expected a string, but got numbers!" } }
// highlight-end
```

## Minimum Log Level

Logs are great when you need them, and an eye sore when you don't.

It's always the worst when you're trying to debug a certain issue, or see what's going on in your application, but your
output is flooded with verbose logs that you don't need right now.

To fix this, you can set the minimum level that should actually be sent to the console.

:::info

By default, this is set to `VERBOSE` when in studio and `WARNING` when in a published game. If you are fine with the
defaults, you don't need to change it.

:::

### Config

The first way to configure this is via the `minLogLevel` setting in your config.

```ts
import { rLog, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog({ minLogLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG });

logger.v("Hello verbose!");
logger.d("Hello debug!");
logger.i("Hello info!");
```

```logs title="Console"
[DEBUG]: Hello debug!
[INFO]: Hello info!
```

Levels that are less than the provided `minLogLevel` are effectively "filtered out", and don't make it through to the
console.

### Helper Method

The second way to configure this is via the `withMinLogLevel` method on `RLog` instances.

```ts
// returns a copy of this logger, but with the `minLogLevel` set to `DEBUG`
const logger = new rLog().withMinLogLevel(LogLevel.DEBUG);
```

This will return a copy of the instance, with the `minLogLevel` set to `DEBUG`.

You'll find that a few config options have helper method alternatives like this; to allow more dynamic configuration or
functional setups.

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about log levels:

- They respresent the **severity** or **importance** of a log
- They're the **first** part of a log message
- They have an **increasing** level of importance
- You can set a **minimum** level to output
- Levels above `INFO` are sent through the `warn` console in roblox
