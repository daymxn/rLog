## RLog.child() method

Creates a child logger with an optional correlation ID.

There are two components at play here: correlation ids, and child loggers.

\#\#\#\# Correlation IDs

Correlation IDs are a way to keep track of logging events that occur in a single "flow" or "logical process". For example, you could create a child logger for a function:

```ts
function buyPet(player: Player, pet: PetId) {
  const logger = rLog.default.child();
  logger.v("Player is purchasing a pet", { player: player, pet: pet });

  // ... buy pet

  logger.d("Player pet bought");
}

buyPet(Players.LocalPlayer, "1");
// > [VERBOSE]: Player is purchasing a pet
// > { "correlation_id": "adss8fd_1318za_112", "data": { "player": 1333, "pet": "1" } }
// >
// > [DEBUG]: Player pet bought
// > { "correlation_id": "adss8fd_1318za_112" }
```
Correlation IDs can be used to track the flow of a function call. This is especially useful in client to server remote calls, where you want each call to be associated with its own logs.

This also helps in preventing the need to re-log data, as you can filter for the correlation id to find the relevant data.

\#\#\#\# Child Loggers

The relationship between a parent and child logger comes with two benefits:

\#\#\#\#\# Shared Correlation IDs

The child logger will (by default) inherit the correlation id of the parent.

If you provide your own `correlation_id`<!-- -->, it will override the child's.

If you don't provide one, and the parent doesn't have one, a new will be generated.

Although, this behavior can be disabled with the [autoGenerateCorrelation](./rlog.rlogconfig.md) setting.

\#\#\#\#\# Shared Sinks and Enrichers

A child logger has its own sinks and enrichers, meaning you can attach sinks and enrichers to only the child logger without affecting the parent.

But after a child logger has called its own enrichers (if any), it will then call the parent's.

It will repeat this process with sinks.

\#\#\#\#\# Usage

Child loggers are especially useful when tracking the control flow across multiple functions:

```
import { PurchaseHandler } from "./purchaseHandler";

const Logger = new rLog(settings, "Actions");

function buyPet(player: Player, pet: PetId) {
  const logger = Logger.child();
  logger.v("Player is purchasing a pet", { player: player, pet: pet });

  PurchaseHandler.processPet(logger, player, pet);

  logger.d("Player pet bought");
}

buyPet(Players.LocalPlayer, "1");
// > [VERBOSE]: Actions -> Player is purchasing a pet
// > { "correlation_id": "adss8fd_1318za_112", "data": { "player": 1333, "pet": "1" } }
// >
// > [VERBOSE]: PurchaseHandler -> Processing a pet purchase
// > { "correlation_id": "adss8fd_1318za_112", "data": { "player": 1333, "pet": "1" } }
// >
// > [DEBUG]: PurchaseHandler -> Pet purchase processed
// > { "correlation_id": "adss8fd_1318za_112" }
// >
// > [DEBUG]: Actions -> Player pet bought
// > { "correlation_id": "adss8fd_1318za_112" }
```
