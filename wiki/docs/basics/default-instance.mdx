# Default Instance

If you have no need for Log Context, individual configs, or any of the more advanced features **rLog** provides; then
creating individual instances can be a bit too much.

The default ("global") instance allows you to set up a single configuration, and use it anywhere.

:::info what you'll learn

- What the default instance is
- How to apply global configuration settings
- How configuration inheritance works

:::

## Usage

The default instance is accessible through either `rLog.default` or the `rLogger` alias.

```ts
import { rLog, rLogger } from "@rbxts/rlog";

rLogger.info("Hello world!");
rLog.default.info("Hello world!");
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Hello world!

[INFO]: Hello world!
```

## Configuration

The default instance is the _only_ **rLog** that you can update the config for without creating a new instance.
Individual **rLog** instances are, by design, immutable.

But in doing so, you have a few different ways of going about it.

### Set a Config

The simplest way is "setting" the default config to your own.

```ts
import { rLog, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";

rLog.SetDefaultConfig({ minLogLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG });
```

This will overwrite the current default config with your own.

This will also override certain default configurations, such as the roblox console sink. If you _don't_ want to do that,
then the next section is for you.

### Merge Configs

The more practical way is "updating" the default config; creating a merge between the existing config and your own.

```ts
import { rLog, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({ minLogLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG });
```

If there's any overlap between the current config and your own, the new config that you provide will take precedence.
But otherwise, everything else will remain the same.

### Reset the Config

You'll rarely need to, but if you get into a situation where you want to completely wipe the default config back to its
original settings, you can do that.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

rLog.ResetDefaultConfig();
```

### Inheritance

All individual **rLog** instances inherit their settings from the default instance; effectively creating a merged
config.

```ts
import { rLog, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({ minLogLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG });

// implicitly has the minLogLevel set to DEBUG
const logger = new rLog({ tag: "MyCoolLogger" });
```

:::warning

While instances inherit from the default config, they only do so at creation time.

So if you update or otherwise change the default config _after_ creating an instance, it won't inherit the changes.

```ts
import { rLog, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";

// does not have its minLogLevel set to DEBUG
// error-next-line
const logger = new rLog({ tag: "MyCoolLogger" });

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({ minLogLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG });
```

:::

#### Settings not Inherited

Some settings are unique in that they are not inherited, or they do so in a specific way.

##### Tags

Tags are not inherited at all. So setting a tag on the default instance has practically no effect downstream.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({ tag: "Main" });
const logger = new rLog();

rLogger.i("Hello world!");
logger.i("Goodbye world!");
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Main -> Hello world!

[INFO]: Goodbye world!
```

##### Sinks & Enrichers

Sinks and enrichers are applied bottom up, without duplicates.

This means if a new instance is created with its own sinks; they will run before the default instance sinks.

:::info

Bottom-up meaning from the perspective of instances. They still run in the _order_ they're added, but newer instances
have their sinks and enrichers ran before older sinks and enrichers.

:::

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({
  enrichers: [
    (entry) => {
      entry.message = `${entry.message}1`;
      return entry;
    },
  ],
});

const logger = new rLog({
  enrichers: [
    (entry) => {
      entry.message = `${entry.message}2`;
      return entry;
    },
  ],
});

logger.i("Enrichers: ");
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Enrichers: 21
```

Or if a new instance is created with similiar sinks or enrichers to the default instance; those will also run before
others.

This is what "without duplicates" means.

```ts
import { rLog, LogEntry } from "@rbxts/rlog";

function AddFiveToMessageEnricher(entry: LogEntry): LogEntry {
  entry.message = `${entry.message}5`;
  return entry;
}

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({
  enrichers: [
    AddFiveToMessageEnricher,
    (entry) => {
      entry.message = `${entry.message}1`;
      return entry;
    },
  ],
});

const logger = new rLog({
  enrichers: [
    AddFiveToMessageEnricher,
    (entry) => {
      entry.message = `${entry.message}2`;
      return entry;
    },
  ],
});

logger.i("Enrichers: ");
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Enrichers: 521
```

Even though `AddFiveToMessageEnricher` was added already, re-adding effectively overwrites its position in the enricher
queue.

#### Disabling Inheritance

If you have an instance that you don't want to inherit the default configuration for, you can toggle the
`inheritDefault` parameter when creating it.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({
  enrichers: [
    (entry) => {
      entry.message = `${entry.message}1`;
      return entry;
    },
  ],
});

const logger = new rLog({ inheritDefault: false });

logger.i("Enrichers: ");
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Enrichers:
```

By default, this parameter is set to `true`; meaning that instances inherit from default.

## Best Practices

- **Centrialize global settings**: If you find yourself repeating the same config settings over and over again for every
  logger, they may be better defined in the global scope.
- **Keep default usage simple**: The default instance offers a means for quick debugging, and covers simple use cases.
  But **rLog** as a whole is generally designed around the principle of shared context- which doesn't really apply when
  you only have a single instance.
- **Take advantage of config merging**: Configs are merged by default, so you rarely should need to repeat yourself.
  It's more practical to hoist your common settings to a centrialized place- and abuse config merging to keep things
  simple.

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about the default instance:

- The default instance is the **global** instance of **rLog** that's useful for **simple** usage.
- All individual instances **inherit** their configurations from the global instance.
- Configurations between instances are **merged**, helping you follow DRY principles.
- Sinks and enrichers are ran **bottom-up** _per instance_ and _without_ **duplicates**.
