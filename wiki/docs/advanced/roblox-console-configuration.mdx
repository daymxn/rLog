# Roblox Console Configuration

**rLog** provides the `robloxConsoleSink` as a default sink for outputting to the roblox console, with sensible defaults
for formatting and behavior. Sometimes though, you may want to customize this behavior to fit your own use-case.

:::info what you'll learn

- How the `robloxConsoleSink` is applied to instances
- How to configure the `robloxConsoleSink`
- How to customize the format of your logs
- How to customize where your logs go
- How to disable console output for certain instances

## Configuration

The `robloxConsoleSink` is (by default) applied on the default instance, but you can manually configure it by overriding
the sink.

```ts
import { rLog, robloxConsoleSink } from "@rbxts/rlog";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({
  sinks: [
    robloxConsoleSink({
      // ...
    }),
  ],
});
```

The `robloxConsoleSink` function takes an argument of `RobloxConsoleSinkConfig` that you can use to configure special
behavior.

```ts
export type RobloxConsoleSinkConfig = {
  formatMethod?: FormatMethodCallback;
  outputMethod?: OutputMethodCallback;
  minLogLevel?: LogLevel;
  disable?: boolean;
};
```

### Custom Formatting

The `formatMethod` setting can be used to customize the behavior of converting log entries to output objects.

```ts
export type FormatMethodCallback = (entry: LogEntry) => LuaTuple<unknown[]>;
```

Notice how the output type is a `LuaTuple` and _not_ a string? Since the `print` and `warn` globals in roblox allow you
to specify a variable amount of arguments, you can use this to take advantage of certain features the roblox console
provides.

```ts title="custom-formatter.ts"
import { LogEntry, FormatMethodCallback } from "@rbxts/rlog";

export const customFormatMethod: FormatMethodCallback = (entry) => {
  return $tuple(entry.message, entry.encoded_data);
};
```

```ts
import { rLog, robloxConsoleSink } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { customFormatMethod } from "./custom-formatter";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({
  sinks: [
    robloxConsoleSink({
      formatMethod: customFormatMethod,
    }),
  ],
});

const logger = new rLog();

logger.i("Hello world!", { time: DateTime.now() });
```

```logs title="Console"
Hello world!  â–¶ {...}
```

By taking advantage of the fact that the roblox console will natively wrap tables, we can create collapsible tables in
our output instead of just the entire output as JSON.

#### Default Behavior

You may only want to change something minor in regards to formatting, while retaining the other existing behavior the
`robloxConsoleSink` provides by default.

While you'll need to implement it all yourself, you can use this function to get an idea of what the default
`formatMethod` does:

```ts
function defaultFormatEntry(entry: LogEntry) {
  const tag = entry.config.tag !== undefined ? `${entry.config.tag} -> ` : "";

  const data = {
    correlation_id: entry.context?.correlation_id,
    timestamp: entry.timestamp,
    data: Object.isEmpty(entry.encoded_data) ? undefined : entry.encoded_data,
  };

  return $tuple(`[${LogLevel[entry.level]}]:`, `${tag}${entry.message}\n${HttpService.JSONEncode(data)}`);
}
```

### Custom Output

The `outputMethod` setting can be used to customize the behavior of sending the formatted message to the roblox console.

```ts
export type OutputMethodCallback = (entry: LogEntry, messages: LuaTuple<unknown[]>) => void;
```

This method will be called after `formatMethod` is called, and is the last destination for the `robloxConsoleSink`.

```ts title="custom-output.ts"
import { LogEntry, OutputMethodCallback } from "@rbxts/rlog";

export const customOutputMethod: OutputMethodCallback = (entry, messages) => {
  print(...messages);
};
```

```ts
import { rLog, robloxConsoleSink } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { customOutputMethod } from "./custom-output";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({
  sinks: [
    robloxConsoleSink({
      outputMethod: customOutputMethod,
    }),
  ],
});

const logger = new rLog();

logger.i("Hello world!");
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Hello world!
```

#### Default Behavior

The default behavior is actually very straightforward. It just checks if the entry is of `WARNING` or higher, and
spreads it out to the relevant global.

```ts
const defaultOutputEntry: OutputMethodCallback = (entry, messages) => {
  if (entry.level >= LogLevel.WARNING) {
    warn(...messages);
  } else {
    print(...messages);
  }
};
```

### Min Log Level

The `minLogLevel` setting can be used to configure the minimum `LogLevel` that actually gets output to the roblox
console.

This can be useful if you only want to log certain levels to the roblox console, while still allowing them to be ran
through the other sinks you have.

```ts
import { rLog, robloxConsoleSink, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({
  sinks: [
    robloxConsoleSink({
      minLogLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG,
    }),
  ],
});

const logger = new rLog();

logger.i("Hello world!");
logger.d("Goodbye world!");
```

```logs title="Console"
[DEBUG]: Goodbye world!
```

### Disabling the Sink

The `disable` setting will completely disable the roblox sink; messages will not be sent to the roblox console.

```ts
import { rLog, robloxConsoleSink } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { RunService } from "@rbxts/services";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({
  sinks: [
    robloxConsoleSink({
      disable: !RunService.IsStudio(), // disable logging during production
    }),
  ],
});
```

This is mainly provided as a way to temporarily toggle the roblox console, or setup configuration for only logging to
the console under certain situations.

## Instance Overrides

Since sinks override one another when merging configs, you can configure unique settings for individual instances.

For example, maybe I want to exclude data from my console logs- but only for a specific scope.

```ts title="custom-formatter.ts"
import { LogEntry, FormatMethodCallback } from "@rbxts/rlog";

export const customFormatMethod: FormatMethodCallback = (entry) => {
  if (entry.context) {
    return $tuple(entry.message, {
      correlation_id: entry.context.correlation_id,
    });
  } else {
    return $tuple(entry.message);
  }
};
```

```ts title="pets"
import { LogContext, LogConfig, robloxConsoleSink } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { customFormatMethod } from "./custom-formatter";

const config: LogConfig = {
  tag: "Actions",
  sinks: [robloxConsoleSink({ formatMethod: customFormatMethod })],
};

export function buyPet(context: LogContext, player: PlayerId, pet: PetId) {
  const logger = context.use(config);
  logger.i("Buying pet", { player: player, pet: pet });
  // ...
}
```

```ts
import { withLogContext, LogConfig } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";
import { buyPet } from "./pets";

const config: LogConfig = { tag: "Remotes" };

remotes.buyPet.connect((player: Player, pet: PetId) => {
  withLogContext((context) => {
    const logger = context.use(config);
    logger.i("Player asked to buy a pet", { player: player, pet: pet });

    buyPet(context, player.UserId, pet);
  });
});
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Remotes -> Player asked to buy a pet
{
  data: { player: "Player1", pet: "18219" },
  correlation_id: "QQLRSFsPfoTfgD7b"
}

[INFO]: Actions -> Buying pet
{ correlation_id: "QQLRSFsPfoTfgD7b" }
```

## Best Practices

- **Consider using custom enrichers**: If your intent is to add or remove extra data from the output- then consider
  using a custom enricher instead. Customizing the `robloxConsoleSink` is behavior intended for when you have _multiple_
  sinks and want behavior to be different for the roblox console only.
- **Avoid yielding**: As the same with any other sink, you should avoid any yielding behavior in your custom formatting
  or output methods, as it could prevent other logs from being properly processed.
- **Be mindful with custom formats**: When providing a `customFormat`, you are responsible for attaching the
  `correlation_id`, `timestamp`, and `encoded_data` to your final output. These are things they may cause problems
  during debugging should you forget to include them.

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about customizing the roblox console output:

- The `robloxConsoleSink` accepts a **config** as a parameter.
- Format methods decide the **shape** of the data output to the console.
- Output methods decide **how** data is output to the console.
- Custom format methods are **responsible** for ensuring all [expected] data is present in the output.
- The `minLogLevel` setting can **prevent** logs from reaching the roblox console while _retaining_ output to other
  sinks.
