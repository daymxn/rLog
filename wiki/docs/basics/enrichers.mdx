# Enrichers

Enrichers are powerful tools that allow you to enhance log entries with additional context or metadata. They can be used
to add custom information to each log entry or modify existing data.

## What is an Enricher?

An enricher is a function that takes a log entry as input, and returns a modified log entry. This allows you to add
extra data or transform the log entry in some way before it gets output to the console.

## Creating enrichers

Here's a basic example of an enricher that adds a timestamp to each log entry.

```typescript title="timestamp-enricher.ts"
import { LogEnricherCallback, LogEntry } from "@rbxts/rlog";

export const timestampEnricher: LogEnricherCallback = (entry: LogEntry) => {
  entry.encoded_data["timestamp"] = DateTime.now();
  return entry;
};
```

:::tip

**rLog** actually already provides a timestamp property on your logs, but we'll be using this enricher as a base example
regardless; for its simplicity

:::

## Using enrichers

Once you have your enricher created, you can "attach" it to your **rLog** instances via the `enrichers` setting in your
config.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { timestampEnricher } from "./timestamp-enricher";

const logger = new rLog({ enrichers: [timestampEnricher] });
```

### Order of Enrichers

Enrichers are applied to logs (or "ran") in the order they are "attached" to the **rLog** instance.

This means that the output of the first enricher is passed as input to the next one, and so on.

This allows for complex transformations and data enrichment flows.

```typescript title="timestamp-enricher.ts"
import { LogEnricherCallback, LogEntry } from "@rbxts/rlog";

export const timestampEnricher: LogEnricherCallback = (entry: LogEntry) => {
  entry.encoded_data["timestamp"] = DateTime.now();
  return entry;
};
```

```typescript title="transform-timestamp-enricher.ts"
import { LogEnricherCallback, LogEntry } from "@rbxts/rlog";

export const transformTimestampEnricher: LogEnricherCallback = (entry: LogEntry) => {
  if (typeIs(entry.encoded_data["timestamp"], "number")) {
    const ms = DateTime.fromUnixTimestampMillis(entry.encoded_data.timestamp);
    const formattedTimestamp = ms.FormatLocalTime("LL", "en-us");
    entry.encoded_data.timestamp = formattedTimestamp;
  }
  return entry;
};
```

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { timestampEnricher } from "./timestamp-enricher";
import { transformTimestampEnricher } from "./transform-timestamp-enricher";

const logger = new rLog().withEnrichers(timestampEnricher, transformTimestampEnricher);

logger.i("Hello world!");
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Hello world!
{ data: { timestamp: "August 14, 2024" } }
```

## Enricher Filters

Not all enrichers need to run for every log entry.

Since you have access to the entire `LogEntry`, you can make these decisions on a case-by-case basis in your enrichers.

```ts title="timestamp-enricher.ts"
import { LogEnricherCallback, LogEntry, LogLevel, rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

export const timestampEnricher: LogEnricherCallback = (entry: LogEntry) => {
  // just return the instance without changing anything
  if (entry.Level < LogLevel.WARNING) return entry;
  // ...
};
```

## Common Use Cases

Enrichers are versatile and extensive, and can be used to provide a lot of different features.

### Adding Contextual Information

You might want to add information like a User ID or Session ID to every log entry.

```ts
function enricherForPlayer(player: Player): LogEnricherCallback {
  const uid = tostring(player.UserId);

  return (entry) => {
    entry.encoded_data.userId = uid;
    return entry;
  };
}
```

### Dynamic Data Enrichment

Enrichers can also be used to add data that changes dynamically, such as request or transaction IDs:

```ts
const transactionEnricher: LogEnricherCallback = (entry) => {
  entry.encoded_data.transactionId = generateTransactionId();
  return entry;
};
```

### Conditional Enrichment

Enrichers can modify log entries based on certain conditions.

For example, you might only want to add certain metadata for error logs.

```ts
const errorTraceEnricher: LogEnricherCallback = (entry) => {
  if (entry.level === LogLevel.ERROR) {
    entry.encoded_data.trace = debug.traceback(entry.message);
  }

  return entry;
};
```

### Sensitive Data Scrubbing

You might want to avoid accidentally leaking certain data to your cloud provider or front end users.

```ts
const scrubApiKeysEnricher: LogEnricherCallback = (entry) => {
  entry.encoded_data["api_key"] = undefined;

  return entry;
};
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep Enrichers Simple**: Enrichers should be straightforward and focus on a single task, like adding a specific
  piece of metadata.

- **Order Enrichers Wisely**: Think about the order in which you apply enrichers. The output of one enricher _will_
  affect the next.

- **Avoid Heavy Operations**: Since enrichers run for every log entry, avoid performing heavy computations inside them
  to prevent slowing down your application.

- **Avoid yielding**: If your enricher is running for every log entry, yielding inside an enricher will cause the flow
  of your program to stop in that thread. In some situations this is desirable- but you generally want your enrichers to
  be simple and non blocking.

## Provided Enrichers {#provided-enrichers}

**rLog** provides some ready to use enrichers right out of the box, to cover common use cases.

### Function Tags

Uses the name of the nearest function as the tag, if the tag is empty.

```ts title="actions.ts"
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

export function doAction() {
  const logger = new rLog();
  logger.i("Hello world!");
}
```

```ts title="main.ts"
import { rLog, functionTagEnricher } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { doAction } from "./actions";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({ enrichers: [functionTagEnricher] });

doAction();
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: doAction -> Hello world!
```

### File Tags

Uses the path of the file as the tag, if the tag is empty.

```ts title="ReplicatedStorage/TS/actions.ts"
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

export function doAction() {
  const logger = new rLog();
  logger.i("Hello world!");
}
```

```ts title="ReplicatedStorage/TS/main.ts"
import { rLog, fileTagEnricher } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { doAction } from "./actions";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({ enrichers: [fileTagEnricher] });

doAction();
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: ReplicatedStorage.TS.actions -> Hello world!
```

### Attach Source Metadata

:::warning

Source Metadata is a bit of an advanced topic covered in one of our [advanced guides](../advanced/source-metadata).

:::

Attaches source metadata to a log entry.

The metadata is attached under the `source_metadata` key in `encoded_data`.

```ts title="ReplicatedStorage/TS/actions.ts"
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

export function doAction() {
  const logger = new rLog();
  logger.i("Hello world!");
}
```

```ts title="ReplicatedStorage/TS/main.ts"
import { rLog, sourceMetadataEnricher } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { doAction } from "./actions";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({ enrichers: [sourceMetadataEnricher] });

doAction();
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Hello world!
{
  data: {
    source_metadata: {
      function_name: "doAction",
      nearest_function_name: "doAction",
      file_path: "ReplicatedStorage.TS.actions",
      line_number: 5
    }
  }
}
```

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about Enrichers:

- **Enrichers** are callbacks that can add new or change existing data on a log entry.
- You can add **multiple** enrichers to an instance, but they're invoked in the order they're added.
- Enrichers can decide to **not** operate on data by returning it as is.
