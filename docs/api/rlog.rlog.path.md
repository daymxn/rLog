## RLog.path property

The full path of this [RLog](./rlog.rlog.md)<!-- -->.

A [RLog](./rlog.rlog.md) path is a concatenation of names (tags) of all its parent instances, with the root being `DEFAULT`<!-- -->.

In other words, its the hierarchy of the instance.

Instances without a tag are referred to as anonymous instances, and as such are labeled as `<Anonymous>`<!-- -->.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly path: string;
```

## Example


```
const main = new RLog().withTag("main");
const secondary = main.childWithTag("secondary");
const anonymous = secondary.child();

print(main.path);
print(secondary.path);
print(anonymous.path);
// > DEFAULT.main
// > DEFAULT.main.secondary
// > DEFAULT.main.secondary.<Anonymous>
```
