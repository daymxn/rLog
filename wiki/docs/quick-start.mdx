# Quick Start

**rLog** is a context based server-side logging framework for ROBLOX, designed to help organize and structure your
logging process.

This guide will walk you through the basics of getting started, in just a few steps.

## Installation

First, install `rlog` with your preferred package manager:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" default>

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @rbxts/rlog
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm add @rbxts/rlog
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn add @rbxts/rlog
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="wally">

```toml title="wally.toml"
[dependencies]
Reflex = "daymxn/rlog@1.0.0"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Start using rLog

Once installed, you can immediately start with creating an **rLog** instance.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

// Initialize the logger
const logger = new rLog();
```

:::tip

You can also use the default ("global") instance if you don't need (or want) to create your own.

```ts
import { rLogger } from "@rbxts/rlog";
```

### Logging your first message

Logging messages is easy and straightforward with **rLog**.

Just call the method for your intended `LogLevel`, and pass in a message.

```ts
logger.info("Hello world!");
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Hello world!
```

### Adding data to your message

By passing a table as the second parameter to your logging method, you can optionally output data with your message.

```ts
logger.info("Hello world!", {
  user: "Daymon",
  action: "start",
});
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Hello world!
{
  data: {
    user: "Daymon",
    action: "start"
  }
}
```

#### ROBLOX data types

The table you pass is automatically encoded, and even supports ROBLOX data types!

```ts
logger.info("Hello world!", {
  position: new Vector3(1, 5, 10),
  rotation: new CFrame(),
});
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Hello world!
{
  data: {
    position: { X: 1, Y: 5, Z: 10 },
    rotation: "CFrame(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)"
  }
}
```

### Configuration

If you need more control over your logging setup, you can configure **rLog** with enrichers, custom log levels, and
more:

```ts
import { rLog, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";

// Advanced setup with custom serialization and enrichers
const logger = new rLog({
  minLogLevel: LogLevel.WARNING,
  tag: "Main",
  enrichers: [
    (entry) => {
      entry.encoded_data.timestamp = DateTime.now().ToIsoDate();
      return entry;
    },
  ],
  serialization: {
    encodeFunctions: true,
  },
});
```
