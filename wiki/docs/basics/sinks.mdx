# Sinks

Sinks are an essential part of the **rLog** framework, enabling you to filter or "consume" log entries.

By using sinks, you can direct your logs wherever they are needed, ensuring that important information is captured and
available for analysis.

## What is a Sink?

A sink in **rLog** is a component responsible for receiving log entries and deciding if the log should be consumed or
not.

```ts
export type LogSinkCallback = (entry: LogEntry) => boolean | void;
```

## Types of Sinks

While you can use a sink for whatever you want, they usually fall under one of two categories.

### Filters

One of the most basic usages of a sink is the ability to apply filters to logs.

More specifically, excluding certain logs from the output.

```ts title="remove-admin-calls-sink.ts"
import { rLog, LogEntry } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { adminList } from "./constants";

export function removeAdminCallsSink(entry: LogEntry): boolean {
  return entry.config.tag === "ADMIN" && !adminList.includes(entry.data.player);
}
```

This sink applys a "filter" to log entries, such that if a log entry has the tag `"ADMIN"` and the player the log is for
isn't a valid admin, then the log is discarded.

### Consumers

Probably the most common [and important] type of sinks are the "consumers".

Consumer sinks "consume" log messages, and send them to an external server instead of the local console.

But the "consume" aspect isn't necessarily required.

:::tip

Since sinks have a return type of `boolean | void`, you don't _have_ to return anything. If you don't want to consume
the entry, you can just not return anything; and the implicit `void` return will be the same as `return false`.

:::

```ts title="log-to-database-sink.ts"
import { RunService } from "@rbxts/services";
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { queueLogRequest } from "./log-database";

const debug = RunService.IsStudio();

export function logToDatabaseSink(entry: LogEntry): boolean {
  const endpoint = debug ? "qa" : "prod";

  queueLogRequest(entry, endpoint);

  return debug; // only allow messages through while we're in studio
}
```

This sink sends all logs to our backend, and only prevents them from reaching the ROBLOX console for published games.

So in studio, we can still have our logs in the console AND in a seperate external database for deeper inspection.

## Using Sinks

Once you've created a sink, you can "attach" it to your **rLog** instances via the `sinks` setting in your config.

:::warning

Keep in mind that sinks run _after_ enrichers, so the data you're seeing is after it's been fully processed by all the
enrichers.

:::

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { removeAdminCallsSink } from "./remove-admin-calls-sink";

const logger = new rLog({ sinks: [removeAdminCallsSink] });
```

### Order of Sinks

Sinks are applied to logs (or "ran") in the order they are "attached" to the **rLog** instance.

This means that if the first sink "consumes" an entry, the second sink won't even be called.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog({
  sinks: [
    (entry) => {
      return true;
    },
    (entry) => {
      error("Messages should not log to the console");
    },
  ],
});

logger.i("Hello world!");
```

In this example, the first sink returns `true`; effectively "consuming" the log.

So the error from the second sink is never thrown.

## Provided Sinks {#provided-sinks}

**rLog** provides some ready to use sinks right out of the box, to cover common use cases.

### Roblox Console

Sends logs to the roblox console.

:::tip

This sink is applied to the default instance by default, so you don't need to re-add it.

If you want to configure it though, give the [Roblox Console Configuration](/docs/advanced/roblox-console-configuration)
guide a read.

:::

```ts
import { rLog, robloxConsoleSink } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { customFormatMethod } from "./custom-formatter";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({
  sinks: [
    robloxConsoleSink({
      formatMethod: customFormatMethod,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Google Cloud Logging

Sends logs to the Google Cloud Logging API, so that they can then be viewed in the Google Cloud Console.

```ts
import { rLog, useGoogleCloudLogging } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { HttpService } from "@rbxts/HttpService";

const googleCloudLoggingSink = useGoogleCloudLogging({
  ACCESS_TOKEN: HttpService.GetSecret("GCLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN");
})

rLog.SetGlobalSinks([googleCloudLoggingSink]);
```

## Best Practices

- **Avoid yielding**: Avoid yielding in your sinks, as this can slow down your logging and impact application
  performance. If you're sending your logs to a backend service, this should be done via a queue that gets picked up by
  a different thread.
- **Separate Concerns**: Use different sinks for different purposes (e.g., one for error logging, another for audit
  trails) to keep your logs organized and easy to manage.

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about Sinks:

- **Sinks** receive log entries and decide if they should be processed or not.
- You can use sinks to **share** logs with an external service.
- You can attach **multiple** sinks to an instance, but they're invoked in the order they're added.
