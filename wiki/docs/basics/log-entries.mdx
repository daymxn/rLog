# Log Entries

Log entries are the core aspect of **rLog**. They're what provide log messages, and carry the additional context of a
log.

- What log entries are
- The different components of a log
- How data is attached to logs

## Overview

Log entries themselves aren't nearly as complex as the systems surrounding them, but they do have a decent amount of
information attached to them.

```ts
export type LogEntry = {
  level: LogLevel;
  message: string;
  data: LogData;
  encoded_data: LogData;
  config: Writable<RLogConfig>;
  context?: LogContext;
  timestamp: number;
  source_metadata: SourceMetadata;
};
```

### Level

The `level` is the [Log Level](./log-levels.mdx), or severity, of the log.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog();

logger.info("Hello world!");
```

In this case, `LogLevel.INFO` is the level.

### Message

The `message` is the actual string message intended for the log.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog();

logger.info("Hello world!");
```

In this instance, `Hello world!` is the message.

### Data

`data` is additional metadata specific to the log itself.

```ts
export type LogData = Record<string, unknown>;
```

You'll learn more about `data` in the other guides.

### Encoded Data

`encoded_data` is just `data` in a form that's JSON friendly, and has been ran through the **rLog** serializer.

### Config

`config` is a `Writable` version of the `RLogConfig` that was used when sending the log.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const logger = new rLog({ tag: "Main" });

logger.info("Hello world!");
```

In this instance, `{ tag: "Main" }` is the `config`.

### Timestamp

`timestamp` is the epoch milliseconds in which the log occurred.

```logs
[INFO]: Actions -> Hello world!
{
  // highlight-next-line
  timestamp: 1723757975945,
  correlation_id: "Xzm9InKevNRjvqqo"
}
```

:::info

For the sake of brevity, most of the guides will exclude `timestamp` from their output.

In practice, this will be a part of your logs.

:::

### Context

`context` is the `LogContext` instance that was used when sending the log, if there was one present at all.

Log Context allows you to create linkage between log entries, and is one of the most important features of **rLog**.

But, it's a bit too complex of a topic for now; you'll learn more about it in the [Log Context](./log-context.mdx)
guide.

#### Correlation ID

`correlation_id` is a unique string attached to logs to identify entries that run across different `RLog` instances, but
represent the same "flow".

These are provided via Log Context.

```logs
[INFO]: Actions -> Hello world!
{
  timestamp: 1723757975945,
  // highlight-next-line
  correlation_id: "Xzm9InKevNRjvqqo"
}
```

You'll learn more about Correlation IDs aswell in the [Log Context](./log-context.mdx) guide.

### Source Metadata

`source_metadata` is additional metadata detailing _where_ in the source code this log occurred.

```ts
export type SourceMetadata = {
  function_name?: string;
  nearest_function_name?: string;
  file_path: string;
  line_number: number;
};
```

You'll learn more about Source Metadata in the [Source Metadata](/advanced/source-metadata.mdx) guide.

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about log entries:

- They carry all the **metadata** associated with log messages
- They keep track of **when** logs were sent, and **who** sent them
- They allow logs to carry additional **user provided** data
