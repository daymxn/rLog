# FAQ

### Why should I use this over rbx-log?

It depends on your use case and your style.

From a style perspective, **rLog** follows a more TypeScript/functional style, while **rbx-log** adopts a more C#/OOP
approach.

Feature-wise, **rbx-log** and **rLog** cover a lot of the same ground, and offer many of the same features, though there
are some unique to each.

You can use the feature table below for reference.

If you're just starting, look at code samples of both and just go with the one that feels more natural to you
personally.

Then, if you get to a point where you need a certain feature that the other provides, migrating to-and-from either is
fairly straightforward.

### Why can't the library automatically pass around LogContext?

This was something I spent a lot of time thinking on. If you come up with a solution, I'd be more than happy to
implement it.

So let's ask the question: how do we automatically infer the context of a log?

I came up with two possible solutions.

#### Matching threads to context

You can get a reference to the current thread via `coroutine.running`. You could then create a table mapping these to
their respective contexts.

```ts
const contextTracker: Record<coroutine, LogContext> = [];
```

The biggest problem with this is that it breaks across asynchronous boundaries.

```ts
async function DoOtherThing() {
	return coroutine.running();
}

async function DoThing() {
	const thread = coroutine.running();
	const otherThread = await DoOtherThing();

	// thread !== otherThread
	// error-next-line
	assert(thread === otherThread);
}
```

Internally, individual coroutines are creating per async function.

Because of this, we've now lost our `LogContext`.

##### Coroutine hierarchy

If we could _somehow_ have a hierarchy of coroutines; a tree of which coroutines created which, then we could make this
work.

Roblox doesn't provide anything like this though.

You _could_ abuse `setfenv` to wrap around all `coroutine.create` calls and `task.spawn` calls- but the performance hit
would be way too large. Because, keep in mind, that you'd need to wrap around _all_ modules; even external ones.

#### Using the function environment

Another solution I came up with was recursively tracing the stack for a `userdata` property in the function environment
that can identify the `LogContext`.

This _might_ work, but it'd require using `getfenv`, which would disable luau optimizations wherver you're logging. Not
to mention the performance implications it could have.

#### Using a Transformer

The last solution I came up with was providing some sort of transformer to automate the process.

For example, maybe providing a `@LogContext` annotation that would mark consumers of log context- and automatically
change calls accordingly.

```ts title="Before"
@LogContext
function SomeFunction() {
  const logger = context.use();
  // ...
}

withLogContext(() => {
  SomeFunction();
});
```

```ts title="After"
function SomeFunction(context: LogContext) {
	const logger = context.use();
	// ...
}

withLogContext((context) => {
	SomeFunction(context);
});
```

Or maybe even a transformer that looks at the AST and figures out where context is needed, and drills it down.

```ts title="Before"
function SomeFunctionThatLogs() {
	rLogger.info("Hello world!");
}

function SomeFunction() {
	SomeFunctionThatLogs();
}

withLogContext(() => {
	SomeFunction();
});
```

```ts title="After"
function SomeFunctionThatLogs(context: LogContext) {
	const logger = context.use();
	logger.info("Hello world!");
}

function SomeFunction(context: LogContext) {
	SomeFunctionThatLogs(context);
}

withLogContext((context) => {
	SomeFunction(context);
});
```

Either of these might actually work. The problem is that it would require a moderate amount of investment, and a lot of
testing.

The one thing you _don't_ want to have edge cases in is your logging.

Both of these are inherently "automagical", and are also very error prone if not implemented correctly.

I might revisit this in the future and try to implement it, but it's something that's outside the scope of what I have
time (and the mental capacity) for currently.

### Why should I create different rLog instances?

You don't have to. If you don't need the extra configuration, or correlation id tracking, then you can just use the
[default instance](./basics/default-instance.mdx).

However, there are several benefits to creating individual instances:

1. You have more fine-grained control over configuration.

    - With individual instances, you can setup configuration settings that only apply to _some_ instances but not
      others. This configuration could range from something as simple as different tags- to something more complex like
      custom class encoding.

2. You're able to take advantage of correlation ids.

    - Correlation IDs create a link between logs, allowing you to differentiate between outputs of the same log- but in
      different invocations. In high traffic environments, they're a life saver when it comes time to debug.

3. It forces you into a more functional approach.

    - Individual instances forces you to design your system in a more functional manner, in order to properly take
      advantage of them. Whether this is an advantage or not depends on your coding style. For me personally, I take
      towards a more functional style- so I enjoy having systems that enforce that.

4. It helps avoid configuration coupling.

    - Since you're able to configure each instance in isolation, it allows you to make decisions about your logging
      configurations on a case-by-case basis; avoiding the common pitfall of trying to wrok around a global
      configuration in edge case sitations.

5. You're more aware of where and how you're logging.
    - One of the most important aspects is that it conditions you to be more aware of _when_ and _how_ you're logging.
      Or more specifically, it conditions you to be more aware of when you're _not_ logging. Since you're creating
      instances on a case-by-case basis, whenever you're missing one for a new class or module- it becomes a lot more
      apparent. This can help you avoid missing data when it comes time to debug.

### Are there plans to support message templates?

The decision not to support message templates was intentional, and template support will not be added to **rLog**.

If you want template support, I suggest you check out [rbx-log](https://github.com/roblox-aurora/rbx-log).

#### Why?

One of the core design philosophies of **rLog** is a seperation of the core logging message and the data associated with
it. This decision comes from my personal (and professional) experience in using various logging frameworks in large
scale applications.

Namely, message templates can cause two common problems:

1. Messages become overtly verbose.

    - When data is mixed in with your log messages, it becomes more difficult to understand _what_ a log is saying at a
      glance. Especially when your data is niche or extensively large. When working with a large collection of logs,
      this can significantly increase cognitive load when debugging- and just generally causes more problems than it
      helps fix.

2. It becomes significantly harder to `grep` logs.
    - Because your messages are dynamic, it becomes much harder to filter logs according to simple queries. You have to
      come up with more complex patterns; ones that may or may not cover all the edge-cases. Seeing as how logs are
      typically the one thing you _don't_ want to deal with edge-cases on, this can become a huge issue.

Although, both of these problems can be fixed by enforcing proper logging practices. For example, only using templates
with simple types, or ensuring you prefix all your log messages with a simple string before going in depth.

But I'd rather _not_ deal with that. By not supporting message templates, you're forced to practice proper logging
practices anyways by providing clear and concise log messages; attaching data as a secondary filter when needed.

It also makes log processing much faster, simpler, and reduces the corners (and possible edge-cases) that the logging
framework has to cover.

### Can you add a sink for XYZ?

Absolutely! If you have a platform or use-case that you feel is common enough, or practical enough, that a provided sink
should be made for it- I'd love to add it.

[Open an issue](https://github.com/daymxn/rlog/issues) on the GitHub requesting the sink, and explain why you think it
should be added. When I get the free-time, I'll work on an implementation and add it to the list of provided loggers.

Alternatively, you can [create your own PR](https://github.com/daymxn/rlog/pulls) adding the sink, and I can review that
as well. I won't always have the time to invest in implementing new sinks, so if you can add it yourself- it's much
easier for me to give a quick code-review than it is to research and implement the sink from scratch.

### How can I export/filter my logs?

While **rLog** does provide a bunch of utilities and configuration to help filter your logs before they hit the console,
sometimes, that's not sufficient.. Sometimes you may want to aggregate your logs and look at the big picture.

In these cases, you'll wanna use a sink that sends your logs to _some_ external service. These external services usually
provide _rich_ in-house support for filtering, aggregating, and exporting logs.

A popular choice, which **rLog** actually provides in-house support for, is
[Google Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging).

You can check out the [Getting started with Google Cloud Logging](./advanced/google-cloud-logging.mdx) guide to learn
more.

### Can I use this for client-side logging too?

**rLog** is advertised as a "server-side" logging framework, and it's designed to _only_ be ran on the server.

But that isn't necessarily strictly enforced. You _can_ use **rLog** on the client-side as well.

The drawback is that you can't cross client to server boundaries with context, and certain features may not work (such
as Google Cloud Logging).

Client-side logging is basically a "provided as is" use case; if it works it works, but if it doesn't then I won't be
investing much time fixing it.

### This is confusing, you could have phrased X better

After working on something for an extended period, certain knowledge becomes "common sense".

There might be a better way to explain certain features or processes, and I just completely overlooked it because of my
existing knowledge and bias.

So I'm always _more_ than happy to take feedback; especially regarding documentation or design improvements.

If you have such feedback, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/daymxn/rlog/issues) on the GitHub talking
about it:)
