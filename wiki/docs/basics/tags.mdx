# Tags

Tags provide a way for you identify specific **rLog** instances, and allow finer categorization of your log messages.

## Using Tags

By default, **rLog** instances do not have a tag. You can provide one via two ways.

### Helper Method

One way is by using the `withTag` helper method.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const main = new rLog().withTag("Main");

main.i("Hello world!");
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Main -> Hello world!
```

By default, tags are prefixed to the start of log messages, after the level.

This makes identifying different instances quick and easy.

### Config

You can also configure the tag of an instance when setting the config.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const main = new rLog({ tag: "Main" });

main.i("Hello world!");
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Main -> Hello world!
```

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned:

- You can attach **tags** to instances to provide more fine categorization.
- Tags can be applied at the **config** level or as a **method** call.
