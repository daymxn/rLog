# TODO()

- Remove deps/eslint/tsconfig settings that aren't needed
- Add copyright headers
- Stretch goal: add isX on all class types for consumers to check if they're instances of our class
- Stretch goal: future project ideas: assertions library and serialization lib

assertions lib would be built on top of assert. So no test dependencies; could be used in non test code too
maybe some type guard inferring too? idk if that's feasible though
