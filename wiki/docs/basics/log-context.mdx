# Log Context

One of the most important features that **rLog** provides; log context provides a flexible and powerful way to manage
logging across different parts of your application.

Log context centralizes correlation ids, allowing you to create a linkage between log entries in individual logic flows-
enabling more streamlined debugging in high traffic or asynchronous environments.

:::info what you'll learn

- What log context is
- How to track logs in individual control flows
- How to share configuration between log instances
- How to retain verbose logs only when something important happens

:::

## Philosophy

**rLog** is actually partially designed around log context. The idea is to seperate your configuration from your
individual **rLog** instances, and instead of manually creating individual instances- you `use` your configuration when
needed.

You then pass this context along to the different components of your application in the flow.

:::warning

Log context was not designed with parallel luau in mind. If you're using parallel luau, you may run into issues.

Although, remember that `parallel !== asynchronous`.

Log context works perfectly fine in asynchronous environments.

:::

## Usage

Now that we have an idea of _what_ log context is, let's hop right into how to use it!

### Basic Usage

Log context have a concept of "life cycles", in which you need to `start` the context to use it, and `stop` it when
you're done.

This is needed to support certain features that we'll get into later on in this tutorial. It also enforces strict
logical flows; forcing you to put more thought behind the structure of your application.

You create instances of log context through `LogContext.start`, use the context in control flows with `use` and stop the
context with `stop`.

```ts title="datastore.ts"
import { rLog, LogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const config = { tag: "Datastore" };

export function AddMoney(context: LogContext, player: Player, money: number) {
  // highlight-next-line
  const logger = context.use(config);

  logger.i("Adding money to player save");
  // ...
  logger.i("Money added");
}
```

```ts title="player-actions.ts"
import { rLog, LogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { AddMoney } from "./datastore";

const config = { tag: "PlayerActions" };

export function GiveMoney(context: LogContext, player: Player, money: number) {
  // highlight-next-line
  const logger = context.use(config);

  logger.i("Giving player money", { player: player, money: money });

  AddMoney(context, player, money);

  logger.i("Money given to player");
}
```

```ts title="network.ts"
import { LogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { GiveMoney } from "./player-actions";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";

remotes.giveMoney.connect((player: Player, money: number) => {
  // highlight-next-line
  const context = LogContext.start();

  GiveMoney(context, player, money);

  // highlight-next-line
  context.stop();
});
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: PlayerActions -> Giving player money
{
  data: { player: "Player1", money: 100 },
  correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii"
}

[INFO]: Datastore -> Adding money to player save
{ correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii" }

[INFO]: Datastore -> Money added
{ correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii" }

[INFO]: PlayerActions -> Money given to player
{ correlation_id: "ZnT961Kwlav6JFii" }
```

As you can see, the log context attaches a matching `correlation_id` to each log in the control flow.

This correlation id can be used to filter for log entries in a singular invocation; avoiding the pollution of duplicate
logs of different invocations.

This also allows you to only specify _new_ data, while still retaining debug ability.

Notice how we only specify the `player` in the first log, even though all the other logs are also unique to the
`player`? Since you can filter your logs according to `correlation_id`, the `player` can be implied from earlier logs.
So you only need to log extra data as it's needed.

This allows you to follow more practical DRY principles.

### Automatic scoping

Manually creating context with `start` and manually stopping it with `stop` can not only become verbose- but it's also
error prone.

Failing to properly call `stop` on a log context can cause memory leaks, even if an exception occurs in your
application.

To solve this, **rLog** provides a mechanism for _automatic_ lifecycle managment through `withLogContext`.

```ts title="actions/pets.ts"
import { LogContext, LogConfig } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const config: LogConfig = { tag: "Actions" };

export function buyPet(context: LogContext, player: PlayerId, pet: PetId) {
  const logger = context.use(config);

  logger.i("Buying pet", { player: player, pet: pet });

  // ..

  logger.i("Pet bought");
}
```

```ts
import { withLogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";
import { buyPet } from "./actions/pets";

remotes.buyPet.connect((player: Player, pet: PetId) => {
  // automatically starts and stops the context
  withLogContext((context) => {
    buyPet(context, player.UserId, pet);
  });
});
```

```logs title="Console"
[INFO]: Actions -> Buying pet
{
  data: { player: "Player1", pet: "18219" },
  correlation_id: "QQLRSFsPfoTfgD7b"
}

[INFO]: Actions -> Pet bought
{ correlation_id: "QQLRSFsPfoTfgD7b" }
```

:::tip

`withLogContext` will automatically catch any exceptions that occur within its scope, `stop` the context, and then
rethrow the exception for your own processing; you don't need to worry about memory leaks occurring from unexpected
errors.

:::

### Functional Scoping

While `withLogContext` is generally designed with the idea of being called at the remote level in an event based
environment- this isn't always the case. Maybe your application is more response based than event based.

Thankfully, `withLogContext` also returns whatever you return within the scope.

```ts title="actions/pets.ts"
import { LogContext, LogConfig } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const config: LogConfig = { tag: "Actions" };

export function buyPet(context: LogContext, player: PlayerId, pet: PetId): boolean {
  const logger = context.use(config);

  logger.i("Buying pet", { player: player, pet: pet });

  // ..

  logger.i("Pet bought");

  return true;
}
```

```ts title="remotes.ts"
import { t } from "@rbxts/t";
import { Server, remote, createRemotes } from "@rbxts/remo"";

export const remotes = createRemotes({
  buyPet: remote<Server, [pet: PetId]>(t.string).returns<boolean>(t.boolean)
})
```

```ts
import { withLogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";
import { buyPet } from "./actions/pets";

remotes.buyPet.onRequest((player: Player, pet: PetId) =>
  withLogContext((context) => {
    return buyPet(context, player.UserId, pet);
  }),
);
```

This will return the `boolean` value from `buyPet` back to `onRequest`.

### Asynchronous Scoping

If you have asynchronous behavior you're wanting to wrap, you can use `withLogContextAsync` in place of
`withLogContext`.

This will provide an environment for invoking asynchronous functions, and ensure the context gets closed even if the
promise fails or is cancelled.

:::info

`withLogContextAsync` requires `Promises.lua` at `^4.0.0`, which (at the time of this writing) not released for
`roblox-ts` yet.

To workaround this, **rLog** bundles `Promises.lua`. If you're using an older version, you make run into issues.

:::

```ts
import { withLogContextAsync } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";
import { buyPet } from "./actions/pets";

remotes.buyPet.onRequest((player: Player, pet: PetId) =>
  withLogContextAsync(async (context) => {
    return buyPet(context, player.UserId, pet);
  }),
);
```

## Configuration

Log Context has an internal `config` that all users of the context inherit from. By default, this is just set to the
default config, but you can specify your own during creation.

```ts title="actions/pets.ts"
import { LogContext, LogConfig } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const config: LogConfig = { tag: "Actions" };

export function buyPet(context: LogContext, player: PlayerId, pet: PetId) {
  const logger = context.use(config);

  logger.i("Buying pet", { player: player, pet: pet });

  // ..

  logger.i("Pet bought");
}
```

```ts
import { withLogContext, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";
import { buyPet } from "./actions/pets";

remotes.buyPet.connect((player: Player, pet: PetId) => {
  withLogContext({ minLogLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG }, (context) => {
    buyPet(context, player.UserId, pet);
  });
});
```

You can use this to pass common configuration to all loggers under a given scope.

There are also overrides for `withLogContextAsync` as well.

```ts
import { withLogContextAsync, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";
import { buyPet } from "./actions/pets";

remotes.buyPet.onRequest((player: Player, pet: PetId) =>
  withLogContextAsync({ minLogLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG }, async (context) => {
    return buyPet(context, player.UserId, pet);
  }),
);
```

## Overwriting Context

You may find yourself in edge case scenarios where you need more fine grained control over the details of a context.

**rLog** provides a few helper methods to assist in this.

### Config

If you ever want to update the associated config in a log context with new values- you can use the `withConfig` method
to merge the configs and create a new context instance while retaining the correlation id.

```ts
import { LogContext, LogLevel } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const mainContext = LogContext.start({ minLogLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG });
const deepContext = context.withConfig({ serialization: { deepEncodeTables: false } });

const mainLogger = context.use({ tag: "Main" });
const deepLogger = deepContext.use({ tag: "Deep" });

mainLogger.i("Hello info!");
deepLogger.i("Hello info!");

const data = { player: { position: new Vector3(1, 2, 3) } };
mainLogger.d("Hello debug!", data);
deepLogger.d("Hello debug!", data);

mainContext.stop();
deepContext.stop();
```

```logs title="Console"
[DEBUG]: Main -> Hello debug!
{
  data: {
    player: {
      position: null
    }
  },
  correlation_id: "QQLRSFsPfoTfgD7b"
}

[DEBUG]: Deep -> Hello debug
{
  data: {
    player: {
      position: { X: 1, Y: 2, Z: 3 }
    }
  },
  correlation_id: "QQLRSFsPfoTfgD7b"
}
```

### Instances

Sometimes you might have an **rLog** instance that was already created, and you want to use a context with it.

In these cases, you can't really call `use` on the context- since the logger instance already exists.

To fix this, you can use the `withContext` method.

:::warning

Remember that **rLog** instances follow the principle of immutability- so you're creating a _new_ instance with the
context attached, not updating the old one.

:::

```ts
import { LogContext, rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

const MainLogger = new rLog();

const context = LogContext.start();

const logger = MainLogger.withContext(context);

context.stop();
```

This will also _merge_ the configs between the context and your logger instance; placing priority on the logger's
configuration.

## Context Bypass

The biggest reason for context having their own lifecycles is to provide support for context bypass.

Context bypass allows logs to bypass the `minLogLevel` whenever another log in the tree exceeds `WARNING`.

You can enable this feature by setting the `contextBypass` setting.

```ts title="actions/pets.ts"
import { LogContext, LogConfig } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { save } from "./save";

const config: LogConfig = { tag: "Actions" };

export async function buyPet(context: LogContext, player: PlayerId, pet: PetId) {
  const logger = context.use(config);

  logger.d("Buying pet", { player: player, pet: pet });

  const playerSave = await save.get(context, player);

  // ...

  logger.d("Pet bought");
}
```

```ts
import { rLog, LogLevel, withLogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";
import { buyPet } from "./actions/pets";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({ minLogLevel: LogLevel.INFO });

remotes.buyPet.connect((player: Player, pet: PetId) => {
  // automatically starts and stops the context
  withLogContextAsync({ contextBypass: true }, (context) => buyPet(context, player.UserId, pet));
});
```

```logs title="Console"

[ERROR]: Saves -> Failed to load player save
{
  data: { err: "Roblox datastore API is down" },
  correlation_id: "QQLRSFsPfoTfgD7b"
}

[DEBUG]: Actions -> Buying pet
{
  data: { player: "Player1", pet: "18219" },
  correlation_id: "QQLRSFsPfoTfgD7b"
}
```

This allows you to set a high `minLogLevel` without sacrificing a proper log trace whenever something bad happens.

### Flushing on Close

Internally, `contextBypass` is handled by a service called the `LogContextManager`.

This service keeps a table mapping of correlation ids to log entries and relevant sinks; keeping them in memory until
the context is stopped.

Although, this also means that you might have situations where logs are stored in memory that might need to be flushed
to a sink- but the game closed before they could.

To fix this, you can call the `ForceContextFlush` method in a `bindToClose` hook.

```ts
import { rLog } from "@rbxts/rlog";

game.bindToClose(() => {
  rLog.ForceContextFlush();
});
```

This will force any pending messages to be sent through the sinks, regardless of the `minLogLevel`.

:::tip

The reason this is exposed as a method you have to call instead of a setting where **rLog** internally binds on its own
is to allow you to handle last call logging on your own.

So if you have some internal system that logs right before the game closes, you can allow that to run before calling
this method; you have control over when the context is forced through.

:::

### Suspending Context

One thing you might have noticed is that the logs that come out from a context bypass are out of order.

This is because **rLog** places priority on getting the important message out over getting the others.

If this behavior is undesirable, and you'd rather have your logs retain their order, you can take advantage of the
`suspendContext` setting.

```ts title="actions/pets.ts"
import { LogContext, LogConfig } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { save } from "./save";

const config: LogConfig = { tag: "Actions" };

export async function buyPet(context: LogContext, player: PlayerId, pet: PetId) {
  const logger = context.use(config);

  logger.d("Buying pet", { player: player, pet: pet });

  const playerSave = await save.get(context, player);

  // ...

  logger.d("Pet bought");
}
```

```ts
import { rLog, LogLevel, withLogContext } from "@rbxts/rlog";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";
import { buyPet } from "./actions/pets";

rLog.UpdateDefaultConfig({
  minLogLevel: LogLevel.INFO,
  contextBypass: true,
  suspendContext: true,
});

remotes.buyPet.connect((player: Player, pet: PetId) => {
  // automatically starts and stops the context
  withLogContextAsync((context) => buyPet(context, player.UserId, pet));
});
```

```logs title="Console"
[DEBUG]: Actions -> Buying pet
{
  data: { player: "Player1", pet: "18219" },
  correlation_id: "QQLRSFsPfoTfgD7b"
}

[ERROR]: Saves -> Failed to load player save
{
  data: { err: "Roblox datastore API is down" },
  correlation_id: "QQLRSFsPfoTfgD7b"
}
```

`suspendContext` forces logs to be "suspended" until the context is closed. They then all get sent in the order they
were received.

## Best Practices

- **Wrap control flows in context**: Having a context associated with each invocation of a control flow will allow you
  to avoid logs being jumbled together.
- **Only log new data in a context**: Since log context creates a straightforward linkage between other entries in the
  same flow, only logging _new_ data allows you to avoid polluting your logs with the same data over and over again.
- **Use context bypass at the global scope**: If you're wanting to set a `minLogLevel` to save on verbose logging, but
  still want to take advantage of the verbose logs when they're needed- then keep `contextBypass` enabled from the
  default instance.
- **Force context flush on close**: To avoid accidentally missing logs, it's good practice to ensure you're calling
  `ForceContextFlush` before the game closes via `bindToClose`.
- **Use automatic scoping**: Automatic scoping handles the creation, starting, and closing of context for you. Take
  advantage of this to avoid accidentally leaking memory- and only manually manage the context when you need more fine
  grained control.

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about log context:

- They carry **correlation ids** for creating linkage between log entries.
- They allow you to **filter** logs in individual control flows.
- You can use them in **asynchronous** environments via `withLogContextAsync`.
- They provide a way to share **common configuration** between log instances.
- They need to be **stopped** to avoid memory leaks.
- You can use **context bypass** to allow log entries to bypass `minLogLevel` when something important occurs.
